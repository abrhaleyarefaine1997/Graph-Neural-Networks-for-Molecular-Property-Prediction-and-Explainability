# Graph-Neural-Networks-for-Molecular-Property-Prediction-and-Explainability
Graph Neural Network–based molecular property prediction using the QM9 dataset. Molecules are modeled as graphs and learned with PyTorch Geometric. The project includes training, evaluation, optimization, and explainability to identify important atoms and bonds influencing predictions.
